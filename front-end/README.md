# What does this site do?
This is the code for a site that allows you to enter in certain preferences that describe your "gaming personality." You are then allowed to look up 
any game that is located on the IGDB databse (a popular API that contains data on hundreds of thousands of games). Once you have looked up a game, 
an API call will be made to OpenAI's ChatGPT API to return a response that will tell you whether or not the game is a good fit for you based on your preferences.
